Homework 7

Using Monte Carlo integration to esitmate the integral of 1-D Gaussian.

With 1000 Random samples, the esitimated value of the integral between -1 and 1 is 0.6863. Which is  0.0035 greater than the actual value.

This method is inefficient compare to other deterministic methods in this case.
